      <h1>NES-RE (NES Reverse-Engineering)</h1>
      <h4>An Open-Source Open-Hardware project dedicated to reverse-engineering the original 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU (2A03)</li>
        <li>PPU (2C02)</li>

        <h4>Introduction</4>
        <p>The end goal of this project is to document the motherboard layout,<br>
           recreate the schematics, and to put together a BOM. (Bill Of Materials: describes all the componentes and their values)<br>
           The end goal is to generate the necessary files and info required to reproduce the motherboard, and most importantly,<br>
           to allow people to study the circuitry and improve on/modify it freely.<br>
           The design will be as true to the original board as possible,<br>
           with subtle changes where needed to compensate for outdated/unsourcable parts, as well as some improvements.<br>
           (Expansion audio enabled, CIC clone that only handles reset and lacks lockout functionality {hopefully},
           and other minor changes) <br>
